## **New units conversion system**

### **Introduction**

A new feature to manage units of measure and unusual conversions. It has three main functionalities, [**Unit extension**](2.29.0.md#unit-extension), [**Unchained unit conversion**](2.29.0.md#unchained-unit-conversion), and [**Unit alias**](2.29.0.md#unit-alias). These features provide a way to create and edit new units, aliases, and unusual conversions via LIVE web interface. It can be found under menu Configurations > Unit Management Tools\

### **Unit extension**

It allows the creation of a new unit that does not exist in the system yet. A valid base unit must be chosen for the new unit and also a valid conversion factor must be defined to that.\
****

![After defining the name and values, the new conversion can be tested on the bottom](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2cEoc7LV0pUZ0MA0nPNLDQRqXiDU-3Hs1Mfn3knGrOewJKi9vP9fRi4oafUsYL\_j-qqk-iuH4bwaAcBmyhWnBbTPrO8FXa2lfsn2rpnVZ7p3obrW6UMkff2s-dzJ\_1X6MU0jLaj5)

****

The new unit will be displayed in the list after creation.

To delete a unit, just click on the garbage icon of the desired item and endorse your decision on the confirmation box.

### **Unit alias**

It associates a new word to a valid unit in the system. It is possible to create an alias for a common pre-existing unit like kg, N, m3**,** or even a new unit extension as created in the previous session.\

The new aliases will be available in the list after creation.

### **Unchained unit conversion**

This feature provides a way to create unusual conversions in the system. For example, in the native system, it is not possible to convert from kg to N. Using this functionality we can add the conversion for that. Unchained conversions can be created using only base units.\
****

![After defining the parameters for the new conversion it can be tested on the bottom](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VD\_soD83iuUIJYbxHdzL1vf4\_UZKRSjUXovU\_DychmrTVr0q03-B5j-I\_HypvFNdvVoPZBo49Z8RSf-kZ-dqVFQLBcj7KIO3m0Jwy6257HCGICjl2UWNU\_OMBiLtuWEqqhKxQBXt)

After creation, the new conversion can be seen on the list.

Although the opposite conversion is not displayed on the list, internally, all conversions created in the interface are bidirectional. It means that when you create a conversion kg -> N it is automatically possible to convert N -> kg.

### **Conversion tester**

Still on this same new session of the web interface, we have a Conversion Tester feature that allows us to test the conversion using any common units that already exist in the system or even new units, aliases, or unchained conversions customly created as previously presented.\

****\
****It is also possible to combine the features during a conversion:

![Here we use an alias, which points to kg unit, to perform an unchained conversion ](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7Oc0sBK3w92nBVMNsCK-vxP3SfI73UHw4g2nT5uSok\_ngwVfDejdbZRPkJUZuzxIMOpz7ofK\_1\_VnfDTh-L-Qq\_rWAi774MNpjptWyehi0guJG0fyM7EbCULrLa7EX2o9yZ9DNAy)

### **Pipes function**

A temporary Pipes function was delivered with this release to permit testing custom units conversions via console.&#x20;

The function, temp\_curve\_new\_unit\_convert(\<number>, \<string>, \<string>) -> \<number>, receives as parameter a number which is the value to be converted, a string that is the source unit of the conversion, and a second string which turns to be the target unit of the conversion. It returns a number as the result of the conversion.  \

### **** **Normalization and Dashboards**

For now, normalization/dashboards are not being affected by this new feature. It will be integrated to be used on normalization/dashboards in the next releases.

\
Although the existing dashboards are not affected, the pipes function mentioned above can be used to test the new conversions in pipes widgets.

## **New normalization engine**

(under construction)

## \[Collector] Remote control OPC configurantion

Adds two new calls to the Collector's Remote Control (RC) API. These calls act upon the store.json file which maps opc tags to the mnemonics we use in the system.

The new calls can be summoned by the Remote Control’s web API using the following command strings:\


* getStoreJson - Returns a Json file with store.json content and the original file's hash.
* saveStoreJson - Updates the store.json file. Gets as parameters a json file (that is deserialized into a storeConfig object) and a hash code to check against the current file's hash code. This call will fail if the hash codes do not match or if the file cannot be converted into a storeConfig object.

These API improvements do not have any effect in the Live project yet. They are available to be called in the Collector via RC but do not yet have a dedicated Live application to call them. This is part of an ongoing work to center interactions with the Collector in the RC functionality and is intended to become the default way in later the future.\

## \[fixed] Unable to save Additional fields at the Assets screen Data Management tab

We fixed a bug that prevented the user from saving changes made to the “Additional fields” card. This card is available at the Crew and Rigs screens, in the Data Management > Data Normalization tab.

## Rest Output security improvement

We fixed a bug when changing timestamp mode. The changes were not applied to the existing assets.\

Besides that, we also change which parameters can be set in the URL.  We removed the parameters for security reasons and they can only be changed on the integration. These parameters are:

* Window span
* Time resolution
