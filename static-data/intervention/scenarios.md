  An intervention can have multiple scenarios that represents different plans or
  or versions of the planned work.

# Scenarios

At the intervention tab it is possible to create an intervention:

![Creating intervention](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (189).png>)

![Creating an intervention with status and rig](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (238).png>)

Then it is possible to configure the execution data:

![Execution data in a intervention ](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (496).png>)

Once that is done it is possible to define attributes for the execution data:

![Execution data configuration](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (522).png>)

Then it is possible to add a new plan for each intervention:

![Creating a plan scenarion for an intervention](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (507).png>)

After defining the plan name and date ranges:

![Plan name and dates](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (503).png>)

A plan is created for that intervention as a scenario:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (247).png>)

After this it is possible to input attributes for each plan:

![Attributes for a scenario](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (403).png>)

A plan can be configured as the main scenario or as a contingent scenario:

![Main or contingent scenario](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (74).png>)

These plans and execution scenarios are used to render a Gantt Chart. More information [here](../../features/data-visualization/gantt.md).
