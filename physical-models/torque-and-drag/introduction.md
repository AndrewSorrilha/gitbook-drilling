# Introduction

Drag is an axial force, generated between the contact force between the drill string and the formation when it's moving or casing. Torque is the rotational force between the drill string and the formation. The Torque and drag model removes superstition and reduces dependence on assumptions from well planning by taking into account all aspects of the plan from equipment specifications and formation properties. It supports conventional and unconventional drilling operations allowing the modeling of all field operations including (RIH, POOH, Drilling, and Rotating Off Bottom) for drill string, casing string, completion, and coiled tubing manufactured from steel and non-steel materials.&#x20;

### Summary:

* Full mechanical analysis including Tension, Torque profiles, contact forces
* Uses Minimum Curvature Method
* Fluid Properties (real-time) to estimate the buoyancy of drill string/casing and able to calculate with multiple fluids (e.g using airlock on Casings)
* Integrated with the hydraulic model
* Uses real-time drill string/casing velocity, bit depth, and fluid properties
* Takes into account wellbore geometry, hole angle, and size
* Link with Torque and Drag module for hole cleaning consideration (WIP)
* Calculate the neutral point(s) location and show it on the BHA schematic
* Calibration of Drill Pipe Weight collecting samples on the vertical part thereby enhance the drag analysis
* Triggers alarms for high drag, side force, buckling, etc.&#x20;
* Ability to:
  * Allow Torque and Hook Load calculations
  * Ensure monitoring of string in hole integrity
  * Assess buckling along the string
  * Benchmark friction factors
