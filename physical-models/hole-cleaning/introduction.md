# Introduction

Summary

* Hole cleaning and cuttings bed prediction
* Suspension fluid hydraulics
* Solids transport in suspension
* Bed formation and transport
* Mass exchange between suspension and bed layers due to deposition and resuspension effects. Deposition and resuspension take into account:
  * Geometry and well trajectory
  * Operational parameters (ROP, flow rate)
  * Solids characteristics (cuttings average size, cuttings density)
  * Flow characteristics (fluid rheological model, flow conditions)
  * Constitutive equations can be calibrated to fit direct or indirect data
* Force exchanges between layers:
  * Layers accelerate and decelerate each other
  * The model will predict locations along the wellbore where the bed layer is moving or stationary
* Two layers cross-section geometry (cross-section areas, wet perimeters takes into account bed volume fraction, drill pipe eccentricity)
* Transient effects: Takes into account real-time inputs such as geometry and operational parameters variation, as well as previous two-layer model results (bed and suspended solids concentration status)
* Constitutive/closure equations allow calibration with field and laboratory data.
* Compute minimal flow for efficient cleaning.
* Lag time and Lag Depth: transient and steady-state
