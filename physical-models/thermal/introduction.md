# Introduction

Summary:

* Mud temperature prediction through the drill string and annular region;
* Energy transported with mudflow, and radially from drill pipe, annular region, and formation/seawater;
* Prediction of changes in temperature in the near-well formation, according to formation, completions and flow characteristics;
* Drill bit heat dissipation will either use real-time temperature measurements or be predicted by the heat dissipation model;
* Will integrate with hydraulics module to take into compressibility fluid model;
* Will have steady-state and real-time/transient modules;
