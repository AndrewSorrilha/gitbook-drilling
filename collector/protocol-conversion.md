# Protocol conversion

The collector is also designed to act as a protocol converter, that is, it can read the data in OPC-DA or OPC-UA format and deliver it on WITSML format. That action could be performed in any deployed instance.

{% hint style="info" %}
When used in pure protocol conversion mode, the collector does not need the presence of a centralized Intelie Live environment.
